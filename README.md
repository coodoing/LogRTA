# LogRTA
  LogRTA is a framework to analysis logs in real-time through flume, kafka and storm. Flume is used for collecting logs and storing them into kafka, finally sending them to storm for realtime computing by [storm-kafka](https://github.com/apache/storm/tree/master/external) modules. Some bolts and examples come from stome-starter.Check more details through [storm-starter]( https://github.com/apache/storm/tree/master/examples/storm-starter).
